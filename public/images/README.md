# Custom Images

Place your own images in this folder (`public/images`).

## How to use them in code

Once you paste an image here (e.g., `my-coffee.jpg`), you can use it in your components like this:

```tsx
<img src="/images/my-coffee.jpg" alt="My Coffee" />
```

Or in `constants.ts`:

```ts
image: '/images/my-coffee.jpg',
```
